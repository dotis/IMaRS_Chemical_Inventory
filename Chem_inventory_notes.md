Notes on Spill Kits:
A chemical spill kit should be stored near each satellite accumulation area for use in the event of a spill. Each satellite accumulation area has different chemical spill kit needs depending on the type and quantity of hazardous materials used. In order to determine specific spill kit components, consult the safety data sheets of the chemicals used in the area. A basic spill kit should contain:

1. A five-gallon plastic bucket
2. Personal protective equipment to be used only for spill cleanup (e.g., thick rubber gloves, splash goggles, shoe covers.)
3. Inert absorbents compatible with chemicals to be absorbed (e.g., vermiculite, clay, absorbent
socks or pillows.
4. Plastic dustpan and brush
5. Chemical-resistant bags
6. Hazardous waste tags or labels
The five-gallon bucket can be labeled with the words “Chemical Spill Kit” and all other materials can be stored within it for quick access in the event of a spill.
